# NeuralNetworks

How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
I chose 2 layers, first layer with 24 neurons and second with 12 with a 100 epochs as it gave the best model accuracy.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
No I was not, the best result I recieved was 72.5%. I tried to increase the number of layers and epochs used to try and inscrease the model performance.

If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
I would chose random forest as it gave me the same result I recieved with my best case model and it is much faster to train.
